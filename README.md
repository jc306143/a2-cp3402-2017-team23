## Assignment 2 - Create a WordPress Theme

### Task

In this group assignment, you will work in a team of 3 or 4 people to develop one website using WordPress.

Your site must be designed using your own custom theme (not child theme) that you create based on any appropriate “starter theme”. As described in the presentation details below, your group must come up with and use an appropriate modern collaborative development and deployment workflow for this assignment.

### Design

The site should use the content provided by the client, but you should perform all the usual design steps like information architecture, interface design and information design. Unless specified as a requirement by the client, all design decisions are up to you. Your custom theme design should be appropriate for your goal and target audience.
